              I like to use the plural-singlar (my name for it) organization with
              HTML. Basically, if you want rows and columns of objects, I use
              a <div> with class="plural-object" and a class for the child div
              of class="singular-object". If you look at my code, you see each of
              the three objects has the same structure, I copied and pasted the first
              one. I can style the .objects into a row and each .object into a column,
              so you end up with three boxes here in a row with their title and information
              in vertical "column" information
